# Specifying Your Own Distribution

``` r

library(distionary)
```

This vignette explains how to create user-defined distributions using
`distionary`.

## User-Defined Distributions

You can make your own distribution using the
[`distribution()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/distribution.md)
function. Specify distribution properties as name-value pairs, where the
name is the distribution property. Distributional *representations* like
the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be specified as
functions.

``` r

my_normal <- distribution(
  density = stats::dnorm,
  cdf = stats::pnorm,
  range = c(-Inf, Inf),
  g = 9.81,
  another_representation = function(x) x^2,
  .vtype = "continuous"
)
# Inspect
my_normal
#> Unnamed distribution (continuous) 
#> --Parameters--
#> NULL
```

The usual evaluation framework can now be accessed, such as evaluating
the CDF.

``` r

eval_cdf(my_normal, at = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.7))
#> [1] 0.5792597 0.6914625 0.7580363
```

Even though the mean has not been specified, it can still be evaluated.

``` r

mean(my_normal)
#> [1] 0
```

Some of the specified properties are special because they correspond to
a property that’s known to distionary – in this example, `density`,
`cdf`, and `range`. In general, the special names can be identified as
follows:

- The suffix following `eval_` for any distributional representation
  (e.g., `quantile` for
  [`eval_quantile()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/quantile.md)).
  These should be specified as functions.
- `realise` or `realize`, which is used to generate random samples from
  the distribution. This should be a function of the number of
  observations to draw.
- The same name as the `distionary` functions used to extract any other
  property (e.g., `mean` for
  [`mean()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html)).

See the [Evaluate a
Distribution](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/articles/evaluate.md)
vignette for more details on these evaluation functions and the network
of relationships between the understood properties. Note that, in the
current version, specifying a `cdf` along with a `density` or `pmf`
(probability mass function) is required for evaluating non-explicit
properties.

In general, properties can be invoked by the more general function
[`eval_property()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/eval_property.md),
which is useful for accessing entries that are not known to
`distionary`. For example, the user-defined property `g` can be accessed
in this way.

``` r

eval_property(my_normal, "g")
#> [1] 9.81
```

To use
[`eval_property()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/eval_property.md)
to evaluate a function, arguments can be specified in the `...`
argument.

``` r

eval_property(my_normal, "another_representation", 1:4)
#> [1]  1  4  9 16
```

The
[`eval_property()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/eval_property.md)
function is also useful for programmatically accessing distribution
properties.

``` r

properties <- c("mean", "variance")
lapply(properties, \(x) eval_property(my_normal, x))
#> [[1]]
#> [1] 0
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] 1
```

## Distribution Attributes

Distribution metadata are stored as attributes, and are those arguments
prefixed by `.` in the
[`distribution()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/distribution.md)
function.

- `.vtype`, as seen in the example starting this vignette, is used to
  specify the variable type, such as `"discrete"` or `"continuous"`.
- `.name` allows you to give the distribution a name.
- `.parameters` allows you to specify values for the distribution’s
  parameters as a list, if applicable. This version of `distionary` does
  not draw from these values, so it currently serves a similar function
  as the distribution’s name.

``` r

my_distribution <- distribution(
  cdf = pnorm,
  density = dnorm,
  .vtype = "continuous",
  .name = "Special",
  .parameters = list(theta = 1.7, mat = diag(2), hello = "hi")
)
# Inspect
my_distribution
#> Special distribution (continuous) 
#> --Parameters--
#> $theta
#> [1] 1.7
#> 
#> $mat
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    0
#> [2,]    0    1
#> 
#> $hello
#> [1] "hi"
```

Retrieve the variable type:

``` r

vtype(my_distribution)
#> [1] "continuous"
```

Retrieve the parameters:

``` r

parameters(my_distribution)
#> $theta
#> [1] 1.7
#> 
#> $mat
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    0
#> [2,]    0    1
#> 
#> $hello
#> [1] "hi"
```

You can also reset the parameters with `<-`. Lets give this distribution
scalar parameters.

``` r

parameters(my_distribution)[["mat"]] <- 1
parameters(my_distribution)[["hello"]] <- NULL
# Inspect the distribution
my_distribution
#> Special distribution (continuous) 
#> --Parameters--
#> theta   mat 
#>   1.7   1.0
```

Retrieve the distribution’s name with
[`pretty_name()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/pretty_name.md).

``` r

pretty_name(my_distribution)
#> [1] "Special"
```

Names are “pretty” because they can also include the parameters in a
compact way, when the parameters are scalars (which they now are):

``` r

pretty_name(my_distribution, param_digits = 2)
#> [1] "Special(1.7, 1)"
```

## Example of a New Parametric Family

If you want to create your own parametric family, such as a distribution
whose density decays linearly from `x=0` to `x=a`, you can do this by
making a function that accepts the distribution parameter as an input,
and outputs the distribution. Note that the CDF and density are
specified, as required for continuous distributions, and metadata are
specified with the arguments starting with `.`.

``` r

dst_linear <- function(a) {
  # It helps to check that the parameter is valid.
  checkmate::assert_number(a, lower = 0)
  # We'll create some representations outside of the `distribution()`
  # call for separation of concerns. Note that care is taken to ensure
  # proper behaviour outside of the range of the distribution.
  density <- function(x) {
    d <- 2 / a^2 * (a - x)
    d[x < 0 | x > a] <- 0
    d
  }
  cdf <- function(x) {
    p <- x / a^2 * (2 * a - x)
    p[x < 0] <- 0
    p[x > a] <- 1
    p
  }
  # Create the distribution.
  distribution(
    density = density,
    cdf = cdf,
    range = c(0, a),
    .vtype = "continuous",
    .name = "Linear",
    .parameters = list(a = a)
  )
}
```

Notice how the distribution metadata gets printed with the distribution.

``` r

dst_linear(3)
#> Linear distribution (continuous) 
#> --Parameters--
#> a 
#> 3
```

Here are the density plots of different members of this family.

``` r

plot(dst_linear(1), to = 4, col = "purple")
plot(dst_linear(2), add = TRUE, col = "red")
plot(dst_linear(4), add = TRUE, col = "blue")
legend(
  "topright",
  legend = c("a = 1", "a = 2", "a = 4"),
  col = c("purple", "red", "blue"),
  lty = 1
)
```

As usual, properties can be evaluated, even if they are not specified.
Consider, for example, calculating return periods of three different
Linear distributions.

``` r

enframe_return(
  model1 = dst_linear(1),
  model2 = dst_linear(2),
  model3 = dst_linear(4),
  at = c(2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100),
  arg_name = "return_period"
)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 4
#>   return_period return_model1 return_model2 return_model3
#>           <dbl>         <dbl>         <dbl>         <dbl>
#> 1             2         0.293         0.586          1.17
#> 2             5         0.553         1.11           2.21
#> 3            10         0.684         1.37           2.74
#> 4            20         0.776         1.55           3.11
#> 5            50         0.859         1.72           3.43
#> 6           100         0.900         1.80           3.60
```

## Network of Properties

The key innovation in `distionary` is its network-based approach to
probability distributions. Different distributional representations
(CDF, PDF/PMF, quantile function, survival function, etc.) are
interconnected through a network of mathematical relationships.

The diagram below shows how `distionary` derives distribution properties
from other properties. An arrow from one property to another indicates
that the first property can be calculated from the second. For example,
`quantile` can be calculated from `cdf`, and `mean` can be calculated
from `density`. This network structure is what allows you to define a
custom distribution with just one or two representations (like `cdf` and
`density` in the example above) and still have access to all other
properties.

## Making your own properties

Some properties are easy to make yourself. Here is an example of a
function that calculates interquartile range.

``` r

# Make a function that takes a distribution as input, and returns the
# interquartile range.
iqr <- function(distribution) {
  diff(eval_quantile(distribution, at = c(0.25, 0.75)))
}
```

Apply the function to a Linear distribution as defined before.

``` r

iqr(dst_linear(2))
#> [1] 0.7320508
```

For properties that are not handled by `distionary` (e.g., extreme value
index, or moment generating function), one option is to build these
properties into your own distribution. A future version of `distionary`
will make user-defined properties easier to work with.

## Limitations

The `distionary` package is still young. Lots of helpful features are
still missing, and your patience is appreciated as more features are
developed. Some examples follow.

| \# | Limitation | Explanation |
|----|----|----|
| 1\. | When a user-specified distribution isn’t continuous (e.g., is discrete), only the properties specified in [`distribution()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/distribution.md) can be accessed in this version. | Specifying the set of possible outcomes for discrete distributions requires special attention, particularly when there are infinitely many of them. |
| 2\. | Representations are not checked for accuracy in this version. | While this is done in the test suite for the built-in distributions, additional levels of detail are required when accepting a foreign distribution. |
| 3\. | Typos when specifying distribution property names (e.g. `densty` instead of `density`) or variable type (e.g., `"contnous"` instead of `"continuous"`) will not trigger an error. | The package does not assume that distribution properties and types are limited, allowing for flexibility. |
| 4\. | It is currently assumed that the distributional representations are specified in a way that remains valid beyond the range of the distribution. | A future version aims to use the specified range to automatically implement appropriate behavior. |
