# Pseudocode

This document outlines the core functionalities of `distionary` for
other programming languages. Developers can add extra checks as needed.

## Distribution Objects

Distribution objects store user-defined properties and distribution
metadata. The key metadata field is `vtype` (e.g., continuous, discrete,
mixed). Properties and metadata are bundled in a dictionary-like
structure ([`{}`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Paren.html)).

    distribution = function(properties, vtype = Null):
      return {properties = properties, vtype = vtype}

Currently, `distionary` supports only numeric, univariate distributions
(i.e., single variable). Future versions will support multivariate
distributions.

## Common Distribution Families

Wrappers allow access to common distributions like Normal and Poisson,
prefixed with `dst_`. For example:

    dst_norm = function(mean, sd):
      return distribution(
        properties = [
          density = function(x) dnorm(x, mean = mean, sd = sd),
          realise = function(n) rnorm(n, mean = mean, sd = sd),
          ...,
          range = [-Inf, Inf],
          mean = mean,
          stdev = sd,
          skewness = 0,
          ...
        ],
        vtype = "continuous"
      )

Here, `[]` is a list-like structure that can be used to pass arguments
to the function. `dnorm` and `rnorm` are assumed to be available or
should be implemented manually.

In addition to common families, a Null distribution that always
evaluates to NA should be created. This object is useful when external
algorithms fail, where a Null distribution can be output instead of an
error.

## Evaluating

Start with thin wrappers for evaluating specific properties, which
invoke the general function `eval_property`.

Properties that are not functions can be accessed by functions of the
same name:

    mean = function(distribution):
      eval_property(distribution, name = "mean")

    range = function(distribution):
      eval_property(distribution, name = "range")

Properties that are functions are prefixed with `eval_` to indicate they
require an argument, passed with `at`. All such properties currently in
distionary only have one argument, but in principle could accept others;
these all go in `[]`.

    eval_density = function(distribution, at):
      eval_property(distribution, name = "density", args = [at])

    eval_survival = function(distribution, at):
      eval_property(distribution, name = "cdf", args = [at])

The `at` parameter can accept a vector of values. The current version
supports a single distribution input, but future versions might allow
recycling both arguments.

The main function `eval_property` evaluates properties if present or
delegates network evaluation. If the property is a function, it will
evaluate it using the provided arguments in `args`. By default, `args`
is `Null`, meaning arguments are not relevant (therefore, this argument
can be ignored for numeric properties).

    eval_property = function(distribution, property_name, args = Null):
      properties = subset(distribution, "properties")
      property = subset(properties, property_name)
      if is_null(property):
        return eval_from_network(distribution, name = property_name, args = args)
      else if is_function(property):
        return property(args)
      else:
        return property

Use `subset` to retrieve entries from dictionary-like structures.
`property(args)` means to call the function property with arguments.

The absence of a property is evaluated using a [network of
properties](https://distionary.probaverse.com/articles/specify-user-defined#network-of-properties),
specifying how one property can be retrieved from others. For example,
the cumulative hazard function (CHF) can be calculated using the
survival function:

    eval_from_network = function(distribution, name, args):
      if name == "chf":
        return -log(eval_survival(distribution, args))
      if name == "survival":
        return 1 - eval_cdf(distribution, args)
      if name == "mean":
      ...

Network evaluation is still robust against whether the survival function
has been specified for the distribution due to the use of
`eval_survival`: if the survival function can’t be retrieved from the
distribution, it will evaluate it from the network, this time from the
cumulative distribution function (CDF). The network has been set up to
avoid getting caught in a loop, so that the survival function doesn’t
look back to the CHF for evaluation – it’s (mostly) a directed acyclic
graph.

Network computation failures throw errors, though future versions might
allow user-specified error-handling strategies.

The defined network is not unique. For example, the CHF could be
retrieved from the hazard function rather than the survival function.
The network was minimized for numerical efficiency.

Currently, the CDF and density/PMF anchor the property network, meaning
that they are assumed available. Future improvements may implement
networks as their own objects, customized to each distribution to be
seeded from the properties specified in each distribution.

## Enframing

Instead of `eval`uating properties that are functions, `enframe` these
to place inputs and outputs in tabular form. This is useful for
table-centric data analyses. Start with simple wrappers:

    enframe_density = function(distributions, at):
      enframe_general(distributions, at = at, eval_fn = eval_density)

    enframe_survival = function(distributions, at):
      enframe_general(distributions, at = at, eval_fn = eval_survival)

`distributions` might contain multiple distributions. The main function
loops over each distribution, adding results to new columns:

    enframe_general = function(distributions, at, eval_fn):
      tbl = [x = at]
      for d in distributions:
        y = eval_fn(d, at)
        tbl = append(tbl, [y])
      return tbl

The developer may wish to consider features related to column naming.
