# Changelog

## distionary (development version)

- [`dst_lp3()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/dst_lp3.md)
  now supports negative skew on the log scale. Zero skew is treated as a
  log-normal distribution.

## distionary 0.1.1

CRAN release: 2026-04-27

- Replaced usage of the deprecated `ellipsis` package with `rlang` for
  checking expected use of ellipsis (thanks to
  [@olivroy](https://github.com/olivroy), PR
  [\#44](https://github.com/probaverse/distionary/issues/44)).

- [`dst_lp3()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/distionary/reference/dst_lp3.md)
  now prints the created distribution object upon creation, matching the
  behaviour of other `dst_*()` functions.

## distionary 0.1.0

CRAN release: 2025-12-01

- Initial CRAN release.
