# Finite Distribution

Makes a finite distribution, which is a distribution with a finite
number of possible outcomes.

## Usage

``` r
dst_finite(outcomes, probs)
```

## Arguments

- outcomes:

  Numeric vector representing the potential outcomes of the
  distribution.

- probs:

  Numeric vector of probabilities corresponding to the outcomes in
  `outcomes`. Must not be negative and must sum to 1.

## Value

A distribution with finite outcomes.
