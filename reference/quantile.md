# Distribution Quantiles

Access a distribution's quantiles.

## Usage

``` r
eval_quantile(distribution, at)

enframe_quantile(..., at, arg_name = ".arg", fn_prefix = "quantile", sep = "_")
```

## Arguments

- distribution, ...:

  A distribution, or possibly multiple distributions in the case of
  `...`.

- at:

  Vector of values to evaluate the representation at.

- arg_name:

  For `enframe_`, name of the column containing the function arguments.
  Length 1 character vector.

- fn_prefix:

  For `enframe_`, name of the function to appear in the column(s).
  Length 1 character vector.

- sep:

  When `enframe`'ing more than one distribution, the character that will
  be separating the `fn_name` and the distribution name. Length 1
  character vector.

## Value

The evaluated representation in vector form (for `eval_`) with length
matching the length of `at`, and data frame or tibble form (for
`enframe_`) with number of rows matching the length of `at`. The `at`
input occupies the first column, named `.arg` by default, or the
specification in `arg_name`; the evaluated representations for each
distribution in `...` go in the subsequent columns (one column per
distribution). For a single distribution, this column is named according
to the representation by default (cdf, survival, quantile, etc.), or the
value in `fn_prefix`. For multiple distributions, unnamed distributions
are auto-named, and columns are named
`<fn_prefix><sep><distribution_name>` (e.g., `cdf_distribution1`).

## Details

When a quantile function does not exist, an algorithm is deployed that
calculates the left inverse of the CDF. This algorithm works by
progressively cutting the specified range in half, moving into the left
or right half depending on where the solution is. The algorithm is not
currently fast and is subject to improvement, and is a simple idea that
has been passed around on the internet here and there. Tolerance is less
than 1e-9, unless the maximum number of iterations (200) is reached.

The algorithm is not new, and is rather simple. The algorithm works by
progressively cutting an initially wide range in half, moving into the
left or right half depending on where the solution is. I found the idea
on Stack Overflow somewhere, but unfortunately cannot find the location
anymore.
