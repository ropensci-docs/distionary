# Representations of the Pearson Type III Distribution

Representations of the Pearson Type III Distribution

## Usage

``` r
ppearson3(x, location, scale, shape, lower.tail = TRUE)

dpearson3(x, location, scale, shape, log = FALSE)

qpearson3(p, location, scale, shape)

rpearson3(n, location, scale, shape)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  Vector of quantiles.

- location:

  Parameter representing the left-endpoint of the distribution; numeric.
  Vectors are allowed except for `rpearson3()`.

- scale:

  Scale parameter; positive numeric. Vectors are allowed except for
  `rpearson3()`.

- shape:

  Shape parameter; positive numeric. Vectors are allowed except for
  `rpearson3()`.

- lower.tail:

  Logical; if `TRUE` (default), probabilities are `P(X <= x)`,
  otherwise, `P(X > x)`.

- log:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, probabilities are given as log-probabilities.

- p:

  Vector of probabilities.

- n:

  Single positive whole number; number of observations to draw from the
  distribution.

## Value

Vector of evaluated Pearson Type III distribution, with length equal to
the recycled lengths of `x`/`p`, `location`, `scale`, and `shape`. For
`rpearson3()`, a vector of length `n`.
